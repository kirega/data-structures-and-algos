"""
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly 
swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

The above function always runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted. 
It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap.

Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes
